## Cards Project (A simple Hands-on project to understand GO)
This project 

## OO Approach (Java)
- Deck class
    - print()
    - shuffle()
    - deal()
    - toString()
    - saveToFile()
    - newDeckFromFile()

## Go Approach
- Declare a 'slice of strings' type and name it 'deck'
- Functions with 'deck' as a receiver

## Project Structure
- 'cards' folder
    - main.go
    - deck.go
    - deck_test.go

## Shuffle approach
for each card in cards, generate a random number between 0 and [len(cards) -1] and swap the cards in corresponding indexes.
